#Creek Theme Tools

This toolkit includes a file watcher, and a CLI for the Themes API.

## Watcher

This tool watches a theme's folder for changes, and updates the remote theme. If it detects a change, then it will take the right action with that file: updating templates, blocks, regular files, pages, or theme.json.

### Actions available

- Update templates.
- Update files.

### Actions in development

- Update theme.json.
- Update blocks.
